# Bootstrap-Code-from-Scratch

## Description

Using the base dataset in Rstudio called "cystfibr", I wrote an original bootstrap code from scratch to calculate the bootstrap coefficient estimates for a regrssion model relating maximum expiratory pressure to forced expiratory volume, residual volume and functional residual capacity. 

## Dependencies

Only install through Rstudio and ensure to install all packages included in the code.
